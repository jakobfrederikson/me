    "description": "I managed to transition to this role while the government has put in place significant budget constraints and staff reductions, making this a fantastic accomplishment. As a Business Process Specialist (a.k.a service desk analyst), I assist our organisation by managing IT tickets, triaging issues, and by handling inquiries through multiple communication methods. This is my first IT role, and it is a genuine milestone of mine to have been given this opportunity (chcek my about page)."

    "description": "This was my first full-time job after completing my Bachelor of Software Engineering in 2023. Although the role is not tech orientated, I became the 'IT guy' for my team, and then managed to become our offices point of contact for the IT team in the Wellington office. The role itself helped me understand how our tax system works. After completing our general training, I was then trained to help with employers! This meant most of my calls and other work were now spent assisting employers and their payroll teams/accountants with their employer specific tax queries."
