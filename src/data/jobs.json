My portfolios are to look after the CISO and Cyber Security team, as well as our old tax system - if any tickets for some reason come in for that. I have gained experience in ServiceNow and Microsoft 365 (Enterprise) in this role. I have also gained a certification in ITIL 4 Foundations (hence the shift left remark earlier)."
