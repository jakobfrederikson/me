# How do I work and continue my hobby?

In my first blog post, I mentioned how I was so excited that I finally found a routine to write code early in the morning before work. I also mentioned how my **shift** started at 10:00AM the next morning.

Things are a bit different now since moving into the service desk in December '24. I am no longer working at an office which is a ~10-15 minute drive away, instead, I'm working in our big Wellington office which can vary from a 40-50 minute drive away, kind of ruining that morning routine. Of course, it's the same amount of time on the way back after finishing work, which doesn't help.

I was also feeling the new job stress which really added to me being tired and grumpy. It meant when I got home, I really didn't want to jump on the computer again and stare at a small screen. Instead, I wanted to stare at a big screen trying to find videos on YouTube that I will end up skipping within 2-3 minutes of watchtime.

Despite the excuses, now a few months in to the new role, I have been managing to find the time and inspiration again to get back into building random things. I recently made a "*replica*" of an <a href="https://github.com/jakobfrederikson/CalculatorApp" target="_blank">iPhone calculator for Windows desktop</a> using Avalonia, which was really, REALLY fun to use. 

I find the good thing about learning a new technology is that it always seems to spark some passion for a week or two. I have now come up with some new ideas after using Avalonia that actually interst me, like a personal budget app and a network health checker. The thought of building something that can potentially be useful in my day-to-day life is what interests me much more than a game or 'side-project' at the moment.

Here's hoping I end up writing a blog post about one of those projects mentioned before by the end of this year.
