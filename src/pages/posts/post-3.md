# How do I work and continue my hobby?

In my first blog post, I said how I was so excited that I had finally found a routine to write code early in the morning before work. I also mentioned how my **shift** started at 10:00AM the next morning.

Things are a bit different now since starting my new role (still with IRD) in December '24. I am no longer working at an office which is a ~10-15 minute drive away, instead I'm working in our big Wellington office doing service desk things. The drive into Wellington starts from 6:40-6:50AM and takes about 45 minutes, kind of ruining that morning routine I had. Of course, it's the same amount of time on the way back after finishing work, which doesn't help.

I was also feeling the new job stress which really added to me being tired and grumpy. It meant when I got home, I really didn't want to jump on the computer again and stare at a screen.

Despite this, now a few months in to the new role, I have been managing to find the time and inspiration again to get back into it. I recently made a *replica* of an [iPhone calculator for Windows desktop](https://github.com/jakobfrederikson/CalculatorApp) using Avalonia, which was really, REALLY fun to use. 

It reminds me of my university days, researching every technology under the sun for a new project and finding one that just clicks with you (that was Qt back then, in my first year of software engineering). I have come up with some new ideas after using Avalonia that actually interst me, like a personal budget app and a network health checker. I really hope I can write another two blog posts about those projects at some point this year, and I'm hoping Avalonia will work perfectly for them!
