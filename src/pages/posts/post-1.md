# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my website about me. These blog posts might be about what projects I'm working on, what games I'm playing, or even a post about the Hurricanes winning the Super Rugby final (watch this space).

As of 29-10-2024, here's my list of projects I'd like to complete, in order:

1. This website (as of this blogpost, I only have the resume section to go and possibly adding tags for blog posts)
2. 'Click the Squares' game in Godot
3. A website that helps keep track of how many hours my partner and I have spent watching shows/movies/youtube(?)
4. Super secret DND app for my group to help keep admin (this one has potential, I don't want Bill Gates to steal this idea and make my millions)

## Finding the Time

I am really grateful to have a full-time job, but I found an issue finding time to work on my personal projects and keep my skills
up to date to since graduating. I have always been the type to stay in bed for as long as I can, but recently, I discovered a nice
morning routine that has been fantastic.

One night, I had that moment we _all_ get where we say 'I'm going to get up early tomorrow and be super productive'. I set my alarm to 5:30AM.
When the alarm went, I turned the alarm off, felt cold and tired, and thought... 'nahhhhhhh', so I put my head back down on the pillow.

But then, nature called. Low and behold, this was what started my mornings of productivity. After a trip to the bathroom, I decided
to stay up, threw on some warm clothes, turned my computer on, made a coffee, and gave Mavis (my cat) some scratchies. My girlfriend would tell you I made a big mistake that morning: I forgot to give her a kiss on the cheek before going downstairs.

That's it. I now have warm clothes set out for me every night for when I wake up, and ALWAYS make sure to give my girlfriend a kiss. I'm not trying to be that person who says you need to get up early, I'm just happy that I have managed to find something that works for me. There is genuine excitement when I wake up because I know I get to hop on my computer and let my creativity flow.

Anyway, my shift is at 10:00AM today so I need to stop rambling. Oh, yeah, I wrote this blog post in the _morning_ ðŸ˜Ž.
